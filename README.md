# After Creating app we install Tailwind CSS
step: 1
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

step: 2 (in vite.config.ts)
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
})

step 3: (in index.css)
@import "tailwindcss";

If we don't do this then none of the Tailwind styling will be applied.

# Now we will install state management solution that we will be use to create the theme of our project.
